Q1. We can use the sql query
SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

By looking at the result(data) we can determine the prominent mood of the user, for example if the averages are high, then we can conclude that
the user likes higher energy, valence and danceability songs.


Q2. These are just averages of the songs, a few high energy songs can boost up the average, which would then not be a correct representation, instead
if we calculate averages for the genres and then compare those averages, we can determine which genre the user likes the most and hence determine
the prominent mood of the user.
